This repository contains a collection of neural models for prefrontal cortical (PFC) cells and networks.
To clone using git: git clone https://github.com/jsherfey/PFC_models.git

All models are implemented in the DynaSim Matlab toolbox: https://github.com/DynaSim/DynaSim

To get started with individual PFC cell models, see "PFC_cells_explicit".
To get started with PFC network models, see "PFC_2layers".

The PFC network model is based on a simpler one with pyramidal cells and fast-spiking interneurons by Durstewitz et al. Matlab implementations of 2002 and 2007 versions of the original model and references can be found in the "Durstewitz" folder in DS02_PFC_deep.m and DG07_PFC_deep.m, respectively.

The model by Jason Sherfey consists of cells from the Durstewitz model as well as others. DynaSim implementations of each cell model, references, and supplemental info can be found in PFC_cells_explicit. get_PFC_cell() is a function that can be used to retrieve DynaSim specifications of individual cell models. Similarly, PFC_1layer and get_PFC_1layer() are script and function forms of a single-layer PFC model with pyramidal cells, PV+ FS cells, and CB+ RSNP cells. 

PFC_2layers is a script that constructs a two-layer PFC model representing minimal superficial and deep layers.
PFC_competition defines two assemblies in a single-layer PFC network and probes how they compete when they are driven by inputs with varying rhythmicity and synchrony.
